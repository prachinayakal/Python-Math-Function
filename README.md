# Python-Math-Function
Python offers several built-in mathematical functions to perform basic calculations. Functions like max, min, abs, pow, round, and sum simplify tasks such as finding maximum or minimum values, calculating powers, and obtaining absolute values.
# Python Built-in Mathematical Functions

This script demonstrates Python's built-in mathematical functions, useful for performing common calculations without additional libraries.

## Functions Demonstrated

1. **max()**:
   - Finds and returns the maximum value from a list or set of values.
   - Example: `max([10, 50, 46, 98])`

2. **min()**:
   - Finds and returns the minimum value from a list or set of values.
   - Example: `min([10, 50, 46, 98])`

3. **abs()**:
   - Returns the absolute (positive) value of a number.
   - Example: `abs(-25)`

4. **pow()**:
   - Calculates a number raised to the power of another (equivalent to `x**y`).
   - Example: `pow(2, 4)`

5. **round()**:
   - Rounds a floating-point number to the nearest integer.
   - Example: `round(12.6)`

6. **sum()**:
   - Computes the sum of elements in a list or iterable.
   - Example: `sum([1, 2, 4])`
